Strategic Insights for Expansion
                     â€“ Analysing Key Trends and Opportunities
                                   
Good morning. Today, I'm excited to present the insights derived from my data analysis, focused on strategic expansion and optimising our market approach. Let's dive into the specifics of how we can use these insights for effective decision-making.

Data Cleanup and Preparation:
Initially, I began with the data cleanup process to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis. This included removing any transactions where quantities were below 1 unit and unit prices were below $0. By applying these filters, we've maintained the integrity of our data, ensuring that our insights are based on accurate and meaningful information.

Visual Presentation Overview:
I've utilised Power BI to create detailed visuals for each query you raised. This tool's robust capabilities allow us to explore data dynamically and extract meaningful patterns and trends.
Question 1: Analysing Monthly Revenue Trends
The line chart used here illustrates seasonal variations and helps us understand monthly performance nuances. Additionally, I've included interactive elements like a country slicer and quantity trends chart, enhancing our ability to dissect the data further and uncover underlying drivers.

Question 2: Revenue and Quantity by Top 10 Countries
A clustered column chart highlights the top 10 revenue-generating countries, excluding the UK to focus on other key markets. The integration of a date slicer enriches this visual, allowing us to adjust the timeframe for deeper trend analysis and better strategic planning.

Question 3: Top Customers by Revenue
A stacked bar chart displays the top 10 customers by revenue, with countries represented as legends to provide geographic context. This not only identifies our highest-value customers but also aids in targeted marketing efforts and relationship management.

Question 4: Global Demand Distribution
Due to limitations with my Power BI licence, a traditional filled map was not feasible. Instead, I opted for Microsoft's GlobeMap to visually represent the global demand for our products. This innovative visual uses bar height to indicate the quantity of demand per country and heat intensity to show revenue, providing a multi-dimensional perspective of market performance worldwide. A treemap also accompanies this visualisation, offering a clear overview of regional performance, which is essential for identifying expansion opportunities and optimising supply chain logistics. A date slicer provides more time frame information.

Conclusion:
The insights presented today offer a clear view of our current operations and reveal significant expansion opportunities. They equip us with the knowledge to target our efforts effectively, ensuring that we capitalise on areas with the highest growth potential.

Call to Action:
"I invite your feedback and further directives to refine our analyses and approaches. Together, we can leverage these insights to propel our company towards sustained growth and success.

Closing:
Thank you for your attention. I am now ready to address any questions you might have or explore further any particular points of interest.
